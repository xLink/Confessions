		<h1>Ready to confess?</h1>

		<p>This is a website where anyone can anonymously submit confessions or stories, either to the public feed or in a localized group.</p>

		<p><a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href-"#">Get started</a></p>

	<p>This project was born out of the belief of free speech &mdash; submit confessions about anything without fear of retribution.</p>

	<p>Along the same vein, we believe that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free">"information wants to be free"</a> and as such this entire project is licensed under the MIT open source license. If you're interested in checking out how the site works, you may view the code on <a href="#">Github</a>.</p>
